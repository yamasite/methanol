This project, written in Python, extracts prototypes from API interfaces files.

## Application scenario

You have a set of client APIs for a variety of platforms. While the APIs are all very similar, you need to maintain the individual interface files if you are using a doxygen-like approach. This approach apparently does not scale. With each new client platform you may need extra manpower for the copy & paste job. This is very disappointing. However, if you turn to structured writing, you need to cope with the prototypes.

Use **methanol** to quickly sync with the latest prototypes in your structured writing files.
